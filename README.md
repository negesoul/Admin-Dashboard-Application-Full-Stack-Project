Admin Dashboard MERN Project

# Summary of the project:
Created and Launched an Admin Dashboard with a MERN Stack. The front-end utilizes Material UI, Material UI Data Grid, Nivo Charts, Redux Toolkit, and Redux Toolkit Query. Meanwhile, the back-end leverages Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose, and MongoDB. Additionally, I utilized Data Modeling using Entity Relationship Diagrams and executing aggregate calls within MongoDB.
